** Important React Concepts **

1. Core Concepts -> Fundamentals.
    1. JSX and Rendering Basics
        JSX syntax and expressions
        Rendering elements & components
        Babel and transpilation
    2. Components (Functional & Class)
        Functional vs Class components
        Props and Prop Drilling
        Component lifecycle (both types)
    3. State and setState
        State management in function vs class components
        Batching of state updates
        setState behavior (async vs sync)
        Functional updates
    4. Event Handling
        Synthetic events in React
        Binding and context in event handlers
    5. Conditional Rendering and Lists
        Rendering lists and keys
        Short-circuiting, ternary, and IIFE patterns
2. React Hooks 
    6. useState
        Initial state, lazy initialization
        Common patterns and pitfalls
    7. useEffect
        Dependency array
        Cleanup function
        Execution order (after paint)
        Common interview traps
    8. useRef
        DOM reference
        Mutable value storage without re-render
    9. useContext
        Creating and using Context
        Avoiding prop drilling
        Context performance pitfalls
    10. useMemo & useCallback
        Memoization and performance optimization
        Common misuse and proper use cases
    11. Custom Hooks
        Structure and design patterns
        Sharing logic across components
3. ADvance Topics:
    12. Reconciliation and Virtual DOM
        How React compares and updates DOM
        Keys in diffing algorithm
    13. Rendering Optimization
        Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)
        Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
        Profiling performance
    14. Error Boundaries
        Handling errors in class components
        Why no error boundaries in function components
    15. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
        Forms in React
        Refs vs State
    16. React Router (v6+)
        Routing, navigation, params, nested routes
        Route guarding and redirection
    17. Higher Order Components (HOC)
        What they are
        Use cases and patterns
    18. Render Props
        Pattern explanation
        Real use cases
5. State Management
    19. Redux (or other state managers like Zustand, Jotai)
        Redux core concepts (actions, reducers, store)
        Redux Toolkit basics
        React-Redux hooks
    20. Context API vs Redux
        Use-case comparison
        Performance and scaling
    21. React Query / SWR
        Data fetching and caching
        Stale-while-revalidate pattern
